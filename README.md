# Dev DB data generator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Project description
This project is created, with the intention for it to be able to generate test data for MySQL databases.
It should generate relational data, based on the parameter types in the columns.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
